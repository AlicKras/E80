title: "E80: Experimental Engineering"
---

# Welcome!

E80, Experimental Engineering, is a sophomore-level, semester-long required course, in which students conduct multiple experiments covering a number of engineering disciplines. 
These experiments are a training ground for a final project: a field deployment where student teams measure phenomena of their choice. 
Experimental Engineering is an essential part of the engineering curriculum at Harvey Mudd College, and has been offered as a course for over twenty years.
Its predecessor E54 - which had more experiments and no field experience - was also offered for more than 20 years. 

The primary purpose of the course is to teach basic instrumentation and measurement techniques, good lab report practice, technical report writing, analysis and presentation of data, the usage of experimental results for engineering design purposes, and the beginnings of professional practice. 
In 2008 the course was revamped to change the field experience to flying fully-instrumented model rockets. In 2017 the course was revamped again with yet another new field experience: deploying fully autonomous underwater robots.

# Mask Policy
Masks will be required for all E80 activities until further notice.

# Github
- This is where you will find updated E80 codes throughout the semester. Git is a distributed version control system where you can download a local clone of a collection of source code files and track changes to the code.
- Lab 0 will walk you through the steps to configure Git on your computer
- [https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80](https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80)

# Course kit fee
- There is a $65 kit fee per student. This fee can be waived in cases of financial hardship. Course instructors will not know about waiver requests.
- Kit payment can be made [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfLGyW_zk6jB89jHjIme0mkHV_LVAtXeJSDNIf7njMEDN1t1w/viewform)

# Team and Group Assignments
- Before your first laboratory meeting, your instructor will assign you to a team.
- These teams are designated using a 2 digit number where the first is your section number and the second is your team's number (e.g. section 1's team 1 is 11).
- Use this number on all assignments. These assignments will be made using whatever method your instructor desires, and the nominal team size is four members.
- Sometimes registration limits in a class will require teams of three or five members to be formed.
- For three of the labs (2, 3, and 5), you will need to split your team into 2 sub-teams.
- A different sub-team must be used for each of these Labs.
- Team assignments will be for the duration of the course.

## Graded Submissions Details

### Lecture Quizzes

- There are seven video lecture sets that you are expected to watch. Each of these video sets has an associated online quiz. You must take each of these quizzes individually.  You may not talk to other people in order to take the quiz, but they are open book, notes and internet.  The one exception to the 'no people' rule is that you may speak with a professor to clarify ideas before you open the quiz associated with the lecture set. 

- These quizzes are completed on Canvas.

### Surveys and Team Check-Ins

- You will be called upon to complete surveys at the beginning, middle and end of the class, and each week, you will be asked to complete a team check-in (a quick peer evaluation) for the lab done that week. Completing each of the check-ins is worth 0.5% of your grade, and completing each of the longer surveys is worth 1% of your grade.

- There are a total of 6 weekly check-ins (from weeks 2 through 7) and they are due each Friday at 3:30 pm.

### Laboratory Submission Sheets

- There are a total of 8 labs in the class: Lab0 through Lab7. For each of the seven labs (Lab1 through Lab7), you must submit a submission sheet that contains the data you collected during the lab. This submission sheet will be evaluated for correctness: it's a way of assessing whether your experimental procedure was correct during the lab. Each submission sheet you provide will be worth 3% of your final grade, and you submit 7 submission sheets for a total of 21%.

- These are group assignments and they are submitted on Canvas.

### Laboratory Writing Assignments

- For six of the seven labs in the class (Labs 1-6) you will be required to complete a writing assignment that is about 1 page in length. Prompts for the writing assignment are included on each lab page. The purpose of the writing assignments is to train you in specific aspects of scientific writing: making figures, using tables, equations, etc. You must complete a rough draft of each week's writing assignment, then you will review your peer's drafts and edit your own during the writing and reflection section. The final draft must be submitted by the end of the writing and reflection section. Each writing assignment will be worth 3% of your final grade and you submit six assignments for a total of 18%.  

- These are individual assignments and are submitted on Canvas

### Technical Memorandum

- Each student will write an individual technical memorandum on material covered in Lab 6. See the [Lab 6](labs/lab6) page for more information and due dates.  You must submit a tech memo to pass the class. 

- Tech memos are submitted on Canvas.

### Final Presentation

- Each team will make a final presentation during Presentation Days, on Wednesday, May 1st, 2024. A detailed schedule will be posted ASAP. The presentation is 15-minutes long followed by a 10-minute Q&A session. The Final Presentation guidelines and rubric are found on the Final Project page.

- Final presentations are submitted on Canvas

### Final Report
- A final technical report will be submitted by each team on the results of the final AUV deployments. The report will be graded for both technical content and proper use of [technical English](https://www.mit.edu/course/21/21.guide/). (see also [this article](https://www.mit.edu/course/21/21.guide/).). A rough draft of your final report is due at 11:59 PM on 4/26/24. The final draft is due at 11:59 PM on 5/1/2024. The Final Report guidelines are found on the Final Project page.

- Final reports are submitted on Canvas.

### Participation
- The instructors will assign you a participation grade which is determined by their in-lab observations, your peer evaluations, and your regular progress through the project checkoffs.

## End-of-Semester Grades
Grades will be awarded on a standard grading scale (93.3% is an A, 90% A-, 86.6% is a B+, etc ...) based on your total individual score.
The professors reserve the right to award grades more leniently than this grading standard.  

# Course Calendar

A Google Sheet with the key dates and assignments in E80 can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qR7HhVNWtqK8va9gGP6NGhX_NoIblt1x9VRRuFam1ng/edit?usp=sharing).

# Course Policies

## Attendance and Tardiness
Attendance will not be taken. Due dates will not be moved. It is up to the group to determine if each member of the team contributed their fair share of the work. For example, if you have a planned absence for a particular lab, you and your teammates should discuss how to shift more prelab work to the person who will be absent for the lab.

## Late Work Policy
No late work is accepted. You will receive no points for work submitted after deadlines. This is in keeping with good professional practice.

## Incomplete Grade Policy
Incomplete grades will be granted only in rare circumstances and require the approval of the instructor.

## Pre- and Post-Lab Work Policy
Each week of the course before the final project can be divided into two periods: a period of time before you go to lab, called the pre-lab period, and a period of time between the lab and the writing and reflection section, called the post-lab period. 
The type of work you are allowed to pursue in these periods is restricted for three main reasons: 
(1) to simulate demands that can arise in real-world engineering, 
(2) to help students internalize the learning goals of the class, and 
(3) to help keep E80 to a smaller time footprint.

You are allowed to work in any way you would like on pre-lab as long as you do not touch any hardware.
You may NOT collect data (for your experiment), manipulate or test hardware, populate a protoboard, or use the laboratory equipment outside of your lab hours. 

You can spend as much or as little time desired on the pre-lab activities, but successful teams spend a lot of time and energy before the lab starts.
You can often do all of the modeling and preparation for data manipulation prior to the lab. 
Activities such as examining and/or writing MATLAB, Arduino, or other code, asking how equipment works, doing relevant calculations or asking professors about the important parts of lab are encouraged.
The only required pre-lab activity is preparing a work breakdown showing how your team will spend their four hours in lab.
An example is detailed in Lab 1.

The only work that is allowed in the post-lab period is talking to your classmates and professors and individually preparing your draft for the writing and reflection period.  
You may discuss concepts, results and the types of analysis you may still need to complete.
You may NOT collect data, manipulate or test hardware, populate a protoboard, or use the laboratory equipment outside of lab.
You may analyze data that you collected in lab in service of your report.
All writing and analysis must be done individually; though you are free to speak to your team during the post-lab period, you may not share drafts, code, spreadsheets or other resources even among team members.

After you have finished a lab, you may not alter or resubmit your submission sheet.
You may not alter your report after the writing and reflection period.
When in doubt about whether an activity is acceptable outside of lab, ask.

## Cooperation Between Teams
Cooperation between teams is limited.
The rules for each period of the week (pre-lab, during lab, post-lab and writing and reflection) are below.
In this section, the word group will refer to a full team of students during a normal week or a sub-team of students during weeks where teams are split into sub-teams.

1. Prelab: A group may discuss the lab with another group to make sure they are clear on concepts and understanding. Groups may not share code, writing, or documentation with other groups.

2. During Lab: Groups cannot work together, discuss concepts or understanding, share data, share code, or share writing.  Groups may arrange to swap hardware to debug and test defective parts of an experiment or device, but they should strongly consider elevating their concerns to an instructor if part swaps are necessary or if parts are being destroyed.

3. Post-Lab: Groups may work with other groups in the same way as the prelab: they may discuss concepts and understanding (including talking about the scale of measured results from lab).  However, each lab writeup must be prepared individually, so students may not share their analysis, code, figures or drafts with other students.

4. Writing and Reflection: Groups are not permitted to work with other groups in any way. 

These work restrictions are relaxed during the final project (after lab 7).
Groups may work on their robot at any time and may discuss any aspect of their robots with one another (as if the prelab policy always applies).  

## Sharing Rubrics
We will be returning/releasing graded lab report rubrics throughout the semester.
It is an HONOR CODE VIOLATION to share these rubrics with other teams or with students enrolled in future versions of E80.

## Access to Lab During the Final Project
- Students may work in the labs any time that it is open.
- Students may only work in the E80 lab when a professor, staff member or proctor opens the lab.
- Any team may use the equipment in the E80 and electronics labs during a lab section, but teams which are scheduled for a section have top priority for the equipment.
