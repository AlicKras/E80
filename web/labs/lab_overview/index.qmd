# Safety Rules in E80

## General rules
- No eating or drinking in lab. If necessary you may leave lab, wash your hands, eat and/or drink something outside the lab, wash your hands, return to lab.
- Know the location of fire extinguisher, eye wash, safety shower and quickest escape route.
- Notify instructor immediately after _any_ injury, fire, spills or breakage.
- Clean lab bench and turn off equipment before leaving. Leave the bench power on.
- Electricity and water DO NOT MIX –a lot of water is involved in E80 – be mindful at all times.

## Proper attire
- Closed-toe shoes
- Short sleeves preferred, rolled-up long sleeves acceptable
- Long pants
- No dangling jewelry – no rings, bracelets, necklaces or earrings
- Loose clothing must be secured away from work (including hoody draw strings)
- Long hair pulled back and secured
- For field experiences:
  - Location-appropriate footwear and clothing
  - Appropriate PPE (including floatation devices for boats)
  - Sunscreen
  - Hydration

## Chemical safety: epoxies and CA (CyanoAcrylate or superglue)
- Safety goggles
- Gloves
- If procedure emits fumes, then must be done in a fume hood or out of doors away from buildings

## Soldering
- Iron must be turned off when not in your hand.
- Use recently soaked sponge. Use spray bottle to moisten. Never use sink or water fountain.
- Use fume extractor: fume from rosin in solder is a respiratory irritant.
- Wash hands after handling solder – solder is 40% lead.  Skin contact is harmless, but ingestion can occur with unwashed hands when eating, drinking, or smoking.
