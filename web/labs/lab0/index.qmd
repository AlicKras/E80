title: "Lab 0: Tutorial and Skills Review "
---

Team size: 4

## Introduction

In the first week of E80, we have a regular lab scheduled, but there is no submission sheet. This is an opportunity for refreshing your skills and getting software and hardware setup for Labs 1 through 7.

By the end of this lab you should have:

- [ ] Chosen and resized an E79 robot frame
- [ ] Prepared 3 waterproof motors, tested them, and attached them to the frame
- [ ] Charged your battery
- [ ] Reviewed breadboarding and use of oscilloscope and power supply
- [ ] Checked out and soldered header pins to Teensy 4.0 **(Limited supply - Do not lose/break/eat)**
- [ ] Set up the Arduino IDE on your computer
- [ ] Set up Github Desktop on your computer
- [ ] Downloaded E80 source code
- [ ] Set up MATLAB

Ask your instructor for any guidance including where to find tools. Don't forget to clean up afterwards. 


Although less critical for this introduction lab, **it will be imperative to get into the habit of distributing work across team members.** Identify dependencies and **work in parallel.** Smells like pre-lab work.

## Frame Assembly

We will be reusing the frames from the ROV's you constructed during E79 but some modifications will need to be made in order to change your ROV (Remotely Controlled Vehicle) into an AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle).

To fit the waterproof box that will house the motherboard, microcontroller, battery, additional sensors, etc., you will need to increase the width of the frame.

Obtain two additional 6.5'' PVC pieces to replace the 4.5'' ones. Don't forget to drill the mounting holes for your vertical motor.

You will be mounting your AUV's motors in the same manner as the three motor assembly in [Practicum 1A Section 4.7](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/e79-practicum/module-1/practicum-1a).

Each team will be provided with 2 used motors. You will need to construct at least one additional motor from scratch. Reference [Practicum 1A Section 4.2](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/e79-practicum/module-1/practicum-1a) for assembly instructions.

Make sure to test that all three of your motors pull less than 500 mA before mounting them on the new frame. To do this, supply 6 V to the motor using a power supply.

## Battery

Your AUV will need power, and we provide that with a battery pack. The battery pack used in E80 is a 3000 mAh to 3500 mAh, 30 C, 11.1 V LiPo battery pack. 
Determine the maximum, minimum and nominal voltage outputs of these battery packs. 
Determine how many cells are in the battery pack. To charge the batteries, we will use a [HiTec x1 Mini charger](https://hitecrcd.com//images/products/pdf/419_X1mini_Manual_BAS-V2-Web.pdf) or a [UP60AC multi charger](http://www.hrpdealer.com/pdf/manuals/UPTUP60AC%20Manual.pdf). 
Read the manual on how to use the chargers.

Request a battery and a LiPo safe bag from an instructor and set up your battery for charging. 
ASK AN INSTRUCTOR OR PROCTOR TO CHECK YOUR RECHARGE SETUP. 
Here are some helpful [images](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1K1DSOdeqAjU_JU-sTOdiBUnwMmpwUTPP). 
Charge the battery up to its maximum voltage.

**Note**: Make sure you plug the balancer cable into the balance lead socket (the black wire should align with the minus sign). 
**Failure to do this may cause the battery to explode!** 
Always use a LiPo-safe bag while charging.

## Breadboarding

A few videos that may help explain how a breadboard works and how to use one can be found below. Note that internal connections of breadboards can break. 

1. [Simple LED Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCJKMFGEuuI):
    The tutorial shows an LED circuit without a current limiting resistor.  LED’s resistance decreases quickly as the forward voltage (the ”on” voltage) is exceeded.  The LED then draws more and more current, overheats and eventually burns up.  Sometimes literally. Please use one.
    
    $$R=\frac{(V_s-V_F)}{I_F}$$

    where $V_S$ is the supply voltage, and $V_F$ and $I_F$ are the foward voltage and current of the diode respectively and can be found on LED datasheet found [ here](https://www.aopled.com/AOP_PDFs/L513SRD-C.pdf).

2. [Breadboard Internals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_a-qCy6Ekk){target="_blank"}.
3. [How to build a 555 Timer circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbz_MKT7KnI){target="_blank"}. Here is a [link with a circuit diagram](https://www.elprocus.com/blinking-led-using-555-timer-ic/). Here is a [video on how the 555 works.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=385&v=i0SNb__dkYI&feature=emb_logo){target="_blank"} 


## Oscilloscope

You will be using an oscilloscope for most E80 labs. If you need a refresher on how to use an oscilloscope, refer to [Practicum 2B](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/e79-practicum/module-2/practicum-2b) from E79.


## Soldering

You will need to checkout a Teensy from an instructor and solder header pins in order to easily interact with microcontroller on board.
For the first half of this course you will only need to interact with the pins on either side of the Teensy; however, you may need to add additional pins during the project phase.

**Teensys are in limited supply.**
Practice boards are available if you need a refresher.

A helpful video on how to solder can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qps9woUGkvI){target="_blank"}.

Remember to: 

1. Never leave your soldering iron unattended.
2. Turn the iron off any time it isn't used for more than 30 seconds.  A good rule of thumb is "The iron is off unless you are holding it right now."
3. Use recently soaked sponge. Use a spray bottle to moisten. Never use the sink or water fountain.
4. Use fume extractor: fumes from rosin in solder is a respiratory irritant.
5. Wash hands after handling solder – solder is 40% lead.  Skin contact is harmless, but ingestion can occur with unwashed hands when eating, drinking, or smoking.
6. Always tin the tip of your iron before turning it off.

## Arduino

You should install Arduino on your own computer using the instructions in [Section 3 of Lab 1](/labs/lab1/#arduino-programming).
This kind of work, where you read a lab ahead of time and take preparatory actions that are in-keeping with the pre-lab policy on the home page, is called pre-lab work.
Pre-lab work is extremely valuable, so setting up Arduino this way is a great first step into the course.

Run through a few more Arduino tutorials:  You will need to solder pins to the Teensy.

1. [Blinking lights on the Arduino board](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial.html):  


2. [Hooking up an external LED](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/tutorial2.html) 


## Github Desktop Setup

Next you need to configure Git on your machine. Git is a distributed version control system. This means you can download a local clone of a collection of source code files and easily track the changes that you make to your code. While we won't be using all the features of git in E80, we will introduce you to the main features that will enable you to interact with the code base for your robot.

Navigate to the Github page with the [E80 codebase](https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80-SP2023#git-setup) and scroll down to the section titled "Git Setup." You can also follow the direct link [here](https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80-SP2023#git-setup).

After completing these instructions you should have a folder on your computer with all the E80 starter source code for the semester and have the Arduino IDE set up to easily access and load the provided sketchbooks.


## Matlab Access

You will be using Matlab to help analyze and interact with data throughout this course.

You will first need to [Visit the Matlab Portal](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/harvey-mudd-college-30622674.html) and log in using your Mathworks account.
If you do not have an account, create one using your `username@hmc.edu` credentials.

To acquire a local install of Matlab on your computer you can do the following:

1. [Visit the Matlab Portal](https://www.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/harvey-mudd-college-30622674.html).
2. Choose to download the installer and select your operating system.
3. Run the installer and log into your Mathworks account again.
4. Select “Individual” license and complete the installation process.

It is also possible to use an online copy of Matlab found [here](https://mathematica.wolframcloud.com/).
