Team size: 4

# Introduction

In the first week of E80, we have a regular lab scheduled, but there is no submission sheet. This is an opportunity for refreshing your skills and getting software and hardware setup for Labs 1 through 7.

By the end of this lab you should have:

- [ ] reviewed soldering, breadboarding, and use of oscilloscope and power supply
- [ ] set up Arduino IDE on your computer
- [ ] download E80 source code
- [ ] set up MATLAB
- [ ] set up Github Desktop on your computer
- [ ] choose and resize an E79 robot frame
- [ ] choose/make 3 waterproof motors and test
- [ ] charge your battery

Ask your instructor for any guidance including where to find tools. Don't forget to clean up afterwards. 


You may complete the following sections in any order.


## Soldering

A helpful video on how to solder can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qps9woUGkvI).
Remember to: 

1. Never leave your soldering iron unattended.
2. Turn the iron off any time it isn't used for more than 30 seconds.  A good rule of thumb is "The iron is off unless you are holding it right now."
3. Use recently soaked sponge. Use a spray bottle to moisten. Never use the sink or water fountain.
4. Use fume extractor: fumes from rosin in solder is a respiratory irritant.
5. Wash hands after handling solder – solder is 40% lead.  Skin contact is harmless, but ingestion can occur with unwashed hands when eating, drinking, or smoking.
6. Always tin the tip of your iron before turning it off.


## Breadboarding

A few videos that may help explain how a breadboard works and how to use one can be found below. Note that internal connections of breadboards can break. 

1. [Simple LED Lesson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCJKMFGEuuI):
    The tutorial shows an LED circuit without a current limiting resistor.  LED’s resistance decreases quickly as the forward voltage (the ”on” voltage) is exceeded.  The LED then draws more and more current, overheats and eventually burns up.  Sometimes literally. Please use one.
    
    $$R=\frac{(V_s-V_F)}{I_F}$$

    where $V_S$ is the supply voltage, and $V_F$ and $I_F$ are the foward voltage and current of the diode respectively and can be found on LED datasheet found [ here](https://www.aopled.com/AOP_PDFs/L513SRD-C.pdf).

2. [Breadboard Internals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_a-qCy6Ekk)
3. [How to build a 555 Timer circuit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vbz_MKT7KnI). Here is a [link with a circuit diagram](https://www.elprocus.com/blinking-led-using-555-timer-ic/). Here is a [video on how the 555 works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=385&v=i0SNb__dkYI&feature=emb_logo)  (While we are not covering this topic in class, a 555 may make an excellent addition to a final project.)


## Arduino

You should install Arduino on your own computer using the instructions in [Section 3 of Lab 1](/lab1).  This kind of work, where you read a lab ahead of time and take preparatory actions that are in-keeping with the pre-lab policy on the home page, is called pre-lab work.  Pre-lab work is extremely valuable, so setting up Arduino this way is a great first step into the course.

Run through a few more Arduino tutorials:  You will need to solder pins to the Teensy unless you find one that has been pre-soldered to the header pins.

## Github Desktop Setup

Next you need to configure Git on your machine. Git is a distributed version control system. This means you can download a local clone of a collection of source code files and easily track the changes that you make to your code. While we won't be using all the features of git in E80, we will introduce you to the main features that will enable you to interact with the code base for your robot.

Navigate to the Github page with the [E80 codebase](https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80-SP2023#git-setup) and scroll down to the section titled "Git Setup." You can also follow the direct link [here](https://github.com/HMC-E80/E80-SP2023#git-setup).

After completing these instructions you should have a folder on your computer with all the E80 starter source code for the semester and have the Arduino IDE set up to easily access and load the provided sketchbooks.


## Oscilloscope

You will be using an oscilloscope for most E80 labs. If you need a refresher on how to use an oscilloscope, refer to [Practicum 2B](https://sites.google.com/g.hmc.edu/e79-practicum/module-2/practicum-2b) from E79.
