## Writing Assignment

In this writing assignment you will learn to make high quality tables that follow the conventions of scientific writing
In addition, you will write text to describe how you collected the data presented in the tables, describe the equations used to interpret the data, and make an argument based on the data presented in the table.

## Statement of Work

Prepare an example methods and results section of a technical memo.

The **methods** section describes how you collected the data presented in the results section and should include any diagrams or figures needed to explain the data collection process.
For this lab, the figures must include an electrical schematic of the voltage divider circuit and clearly show where the measurement was made.
The figure should have a descriptive caption and follow the best practices outlined in the Lab 1 writing assignment.
Your figure should include a short paragraph of 150-250 words describing the schematic and explaining how the measurement was made.

The **results** section should present the data you collected.
For this lab, the results section will be a table presenting the measured and predicted output voltage values.
The predicted values should be calculated using the appropriate model for the electrical measurement tools you used (i.e., your model should include the internal resistance of any measurement tool and the resultant loading effects.)
A 150-250 word paragraph should be included beneath each table describing the results and what they mean, along with noting any particular notable features or discrepancies (e.g., if the measured value is outside of the 95% confidence interval).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this writing assignment you will...

- Learn how to create a high quality table which presents collected data
- Understand the information that should be included in a methods section
- Write equations in methods section to explain the data collection procedure
- Created clear circuit schematics for the methods section
- Write text to describe how the data presented in the table was collected
- Write text to explain what the data presented in the table means

## Required Resources

- [ ] Tables of measurement data from Lab 2
- [ ] Schematics of measurement circuit

## Specifications

### Effort

- [ ] A schematic of the measurement circuit is included.
- [ ] The schematic has a caption.
- [ ] A table with measured data is presented and completed.
- [ ] Text is present to explain the contents of each table and figure.

### Completion

#### Methods

- [ ] Documents the experimental setup with schematics
- [ ] Each schematic labeled as a figure with a figure number and caption
- [ ] Figures properly referenced in the text (e.g., "Fig. 1 demonstrates...")

#### Tables

- [ ] Column headers and/or row headers are properly labeled.
- [ ] Column headers have correct units.
- [ ] Appropriate fonts and font sizes (e.g., 11 or 12 point, professional font like Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, or Cambria)
- [ ] Elements in table neatly aligned 
- [ ] All the entries, including the headers, fit comfortably in the width or height of the columns or rows

#### Results

- [ ] States the main conclusion of the experiment
- [ ] States any shortcomings or outlier data for future exploration along with suggested mechanisms.

#### Supporting Text

- [ ] Refers to each table
- [ ] Explains the contents of the table
- [ ] Correct sentence mechanics like cohesion and coherence between sentences and no run-ons
- [ ] Correct paragraph mechanics like topic sentences and placement at breaks between ideas
- [ ] Language is not stilted and jargon is kept to a reasonable minimum.
- [ ] Includes explanations of units of measurements representative of the data type, duration of the experiment, etc.
